Installation:

    gem install serial_file

=======

The serial_file library provides a pipe between two processes that can
only share read-write access to the same file.  You should use normal
inter-process communication APIs if you have other means of getting two
processes to communicate.

As presently written, the file must be able to be 16 megabytes in size,
and only that number of bytes is actually used.  The file will be
utterly trashed by this library, so only use a file dedicated for this
purpose.

I have not written documentation yet.  Check the RSpec file for some
quick examples on how to use this program.
